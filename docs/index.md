`cgcnn2` is a reproduction of crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) for predicting material properties. This documentation will help you get started with using CGCNN for your materials science research.

## Features

- Training a CGCNN model with a customized dataset.
- Predicting material properties with a pre-trained CGCNN model.
- Fine-tuning a pre-trained CGCNN model on a new dataset.
- Extracting atomic features as descriptors for the downstream task.
