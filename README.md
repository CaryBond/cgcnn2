# CGCNN2

As the original Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (CGCNN) repository seems no longer actively maintained, this repository is merely a duplicated/reproduced version of [CGCNN](https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn) by Xie et al. It includes necessary updates on deprecated scripts and a few additional functions to ensure smooth operation. Despite its age, CGCNN remains a very direct and classic machine learning interatomic potential to learn and use.

The package provides two major functions:

- Train a CGCNN model with a customized dataset.
- Predict material properties of new crystals with a pre-trained CGCNN model.

The following paper describes the details of the CGCNN framework:
